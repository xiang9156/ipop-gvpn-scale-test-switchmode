#IPOP Network Scalability Test

##Description
This tool was created to assist in scalable IPOP networks. This tool is designed as a hierarchical set of bash scripts and operations are distributed/parallelized where possible, utilizing a variable number of physical/virtual nodes (CloudLab, Amazon EC2, etc.) and a variable number of LXC containers to achieve a scalable testbed. The produces are fully automated for productivity (see _Usage_ below).

##Source
In scale/:

File |Description
-----|-----------
scale.bash               |Main script used on a local machine. Instructs nodes.
scale.cfg                |Configuration file.
visualizer.py            |Parse debug messages from IPOP-nodes for visualizing IPOP network.
node/node.bash           |Intermediate script used on a node. Instructed by the local machine; instructs LXC containers (IPOP-nodes).
node/dbg_forwarder.py    |This program is a service that converts debug UDP datagrams from the LXC containers into a single TCP session. This is a solution for testers whose local computer does not have a public IPv4 address.
node/ipop/ipop.bash      |End script used on a LXC container. Instructed by the node; configures/operates on IPOP sources.
node/ipop/<ipop sources\>|IPOP sources.

##Usage
Command        |Description
---------------|------------
accept         |Manually add node connections to the list of known hosts (SSH).
install        |Instruct nodes to receive contents of directory _node_. Nodes install lxc, ejabberd, and turnserver packages. Nodes prepare default LXC containers, one node establishes an ejabberd (XMPP/STUN) service and a turnserver (TURN) service.
init [size\]   |Instruct nodes to initialize platform. Nodes create distributed total of _size_ LXC containers, one node creates an ejabberd and turnserver account for all IPOP-nodes and define all links. NOTE: parameter _size_ is obtained from _scale.cfg_ if not provided.
exit           |Instruct nodes to clear all LXC containers, one node removes all ejabberd and turnserver accounts and undefines all links.
source         |Instruct nodes to receive contents of directory _node_. Nodes then copy sources to the LXC containers.
config <args\> |Instruct nodes to create configuration files for each IPOP-node using arguments _args_.
forward <port\>|Instruct one node to run a forwarding program using port _port_.
run [list/all] |Instruct nodes to run the _list_ of, or _all_, IPOP-nodes.
mem <vnode_id> |Get the memory utilization information of tincan in the specific node.
iperf <args\>  |Test the network throught between two nodes through virtual link or direct link. To use this command you should first type "iperf install all" to install iperf in all nodes.
ping <args\>   |Test the network delay between two nodes through virtual link or direct link.
kill [list/all]|Instruct nodes to run the _list_ of, or _all_, IPOP-nodes.
quit           |Quit this program.

NOTE: "Nodes" are defined as the physical/virtual computers in this testbed. "IPOP-nodes" are instances of the IPOP software running in a LXC container (one IPOP-node per LXC container).

##Example
1. Go to CloudLab.us
2. Create a profile and run it as an experiment
Allocate any number of nodes.
For Disk Image, enter: "urn:publicid:IDN+emulab.net+image+emulab-ops:UBUNTU15-04-64-STD".
Ensure that at least on node is allocated a public IPv4 address - this node will host the XMPP/STUN/TURN services.
Since XMPP/STUN/TURN services are needed, ensure that one node is allocated a public IPv4 address.
Optionally, if a separate node will run the forwarding program, ensure that another node is also allocated a public IPv4 address.
3. Copy connections entries into _scale.cfg_. Example (100 IPOP-nodes instantiated on 3 nodes with 1 also hosting XMPP/STUN/TURN services and 1 also forwarding):
NODE user@cloudlab_instance.A
NODE user@cloudlab_instance.B
NODE user@cloudlab_instance.C
SERVER user@cloudlab_instance.A
FORWARDER user@cloudlab_instance.B
SIZE 100
4. Run _scalabe.bash_
5. Initialize the platform
To prepare the platform, enter the following commands in this order.
_accept_
_install_
_init_
6. Configuring and IPOP network simulation
The platform is ready, enter the following commands as necessary to update sources, create configuration files, or run or kill IPOP-nodes.
_source_
_config <args\>_
_run [list/all]_
_kill [list/all]_
7. Testing the IPOP network
Enter the following commands to get the memory utilization of tincan on each node, test the network throughput and delay.
_mem_
_ping <args\>_
_iperf <args\>_
8. Clearing the platform
To clear the platform, enter _exit_. This returns the script procedures to just after the _install_. To re-initialize the platform, enter _init [size\]_.
